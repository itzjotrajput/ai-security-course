# AI Security Engineer (Industry Edition)

## Overview

This course provides an industry-level understanding of AI Security
covering both Red Team and Blue Team perspectives.

---

# Chapter 1 - AI Security Foundations

## AI System Architecture

AI applications contain:
- System prompt
- User prompt
- Model
- Tools / APIs
- Retrieval systems (RAG)
- Logging & Monitoring

### Red Team Focus
- Identify attack surface
- Map trust boundaries
- Detect weak isolation

### Blue Team Focus
- Enforce separation of roles
- Apply least privilege
- Implement logging & validation

---

# Chapter 2 - Prompt Injection

## What is Prompt Injection?

When malicious user input attempts to override system instructions.

### Red Team
- Instruction override attempts
- Tool misuse simulation
- Data exfiltration attempts

### Blue Team
- Input filtering
- Output schema validation
- Tool allowlists
- Context isolation

---

# Chapter 3 - Model Integrity & Adversarial ML

### Red Team
- Obfuscated input testing
- Evasion simulations
- Confidence probing

### Blue Team
- Input normalization
- Anomaly detection
- Adversarial testing workflows

---

# Chapter 4 - Data Poisoning

### Red Team
- Dataset manipulation theory
- Supply chain risk analysis

### Blue Team
- Dataset hashing
- Version control
- Source validation
- Outlier detection

---

# Chapter 5 - Cloud AI Security

### Red Team
- API abuse testing
- IAM weakness mapping

### Blue Team
- Secure API gateway
- IAM least privilege
- Logging & monitoring
- Secure deployment practices

---

# Chapter 6 - Red vs Blue Simulation

Simulated AI incident:
- Prompt injection detected
- Log analysis performed
- Mitigation deployed
- Post-incident report created

---

# Chapter 7 - Capstone Project

## Project 1: Secure AI Gateway

Build:
- Prompt validation layer
- Output JSON schema enforcement
- Logging system
- Rate limiting
- Risk documentation

Deliverables:
- Code repository
- Architecture diagram
- Security report

## Project 2: AI Red Team Report

Perform:
- Controlled attack simulation
- Vulnerability documentation
- Remediation plan

---

# Chapter 8 - Career Strategy

## Resume Positioning

Instead of:
"Studied AI security"

Use:
"Designed and implemented a secure LLM gateway with schema enforcement and prompt validation"

## Roles To Target
- AI Security Engineer
- LLM Security Analyst
- Cloud AI Security Engineer
- Adversarial ML Tester
